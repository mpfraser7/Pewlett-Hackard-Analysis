## Summary
Close to 54,000 roles will need to be filled due to silver tsunami. It is obvious that there enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of PH employees. However, engineers need to be priotized. We would need to write an additional query to see how many engineer mentees are available. Also, we would need to get more data and write a query to see if we can get a mentor/mentee pairing by region or city.

An interesting new query would be a count of eligible mentorship by title. This would help the company plan for the next wave of mentorship program. Another new interesting query would be the average age of the retirement eligible group. If the company has a history of keeping their empoloyees longer than the retirement eligble age, we would need to factor that in.
